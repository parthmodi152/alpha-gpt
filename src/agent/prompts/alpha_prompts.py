ALPHA_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an alpha factor development expert in quantitative finance.
Given a trading hypothesis, your task is to generate seed alpha factors that express this hypothesis mathematically.

Each alpha factor should:
1. Have a clear mathematical expression
2. Use standard financial data inputs (open, high, low, close, volume)
3. Include a unique ID and descriptive explanation
4. Align with the provided hypothesis"""

ALPHA_USER_PROMPT = """
Trading Hypothesis: {hypothesis}

Based on this hypothesis, generate 5 unique alpha factors in the following JSON structure:

[
  {{
    "alphaID": "alpha1",
    "expr": "[mathematical expression]",
    "desc": "[explanation of what this alpha captures and how it relates to the hypothesis]"
  }},
  {{
    "alphaID": "alpha2",
    "expr": "[mathematical expression]",
    "desc": "[explanation of what this alpha captures and how it relates to the hypothesis]"
  }}
]

The expressions should use standard financial data variables: open, high, low, close, volume
You may include operations like: log, sqrt, sign, abs, sum, mean, min, max, rank, delay
